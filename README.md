Specials Board Terminal Theme
=============================

A Terminal.app theme based on Coda 2’s “Specials Board” theme. Some of the colours have been altered slightly (e.g. the red has been toned down a bit) but otherwise pretty much matches it. To install:

1. Double-click the `Specials Board.terminal` file.
2. Go into `Preferences` (`⌘+,` or `Terminal ➞ Preferences…`) and select the `Settings` pane to find `Specials Board` in your list of installed themes.
3. Tweak it to your heart’s content, or just use as is!
